The Marie Antoinette's site had the following requirements:

* Display information about the bakery
* Allow customers to browse and search the in store menu
* Allow customers to place online orders
* Have a separate menu and order placement system for vendors
* Admin ability to edit menu items and approve new vendors

First I considered using an off the shelf solution such as Shopify or Magneto. Creating a content management system and
ordering system from the ground up is quite a bit of work. Unfortunately, none of the existing systems I could find were able to
satisfy all of the requirements.
