              Hello! I'm John Palgut: software developer by day, gamer by night.
              <br />
              I recently married my best friend, Jesyka Palmer, and we live in Austin, Texas with our two cats: Risi and Orzo. I enjoy building things, solving interesting problems, and learning about cool new technology.
              <br />
              Favorite video games: Bioshock Infinite, Mass Effect, and Dota 2.
