      <title>The Playbook</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects/playbook/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Jul 2015 14:47:09 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/projects/playbook/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Playbook is a webapp I worked on for &lt;a href=&#34;http://pomegranatelab.com/&#34;&gt;Pomegranate Lab&lt;/a&gt; with the purpose of helping teachers create and find lesson plans based on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mindsetonline.com/whatisit/about/&#34;&gt;Growth Mindset&lt;/a&gt;. Development for The Playbook needed to begin quickly and to be in a semi usable state as fast as possible because Pomegranate Lab wanted it to help enhance their coaching sessions with teachers. Due to the expidited nature of the project I decided to give &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.parse.com/&#34;&gt;Parse&lt;/a&gt; a try. In simplified terms Parse handles back end functionality for your app so you only have code the front end. Database tables, User functionality, emails, and hosting are all handled by Parse. Parse provides libraries for several platforms are frameworks that allow you to interact with your app&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;back end&amp;rdquo;. In terms of The Playbook I would write a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application&#34;&gt;Single Page Application&lt;/a&gt; that then load the proper Parse data when the page was created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build the front end I decided to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://facebook.github.io/react/&#34;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt;. React is an excellent JavaScript library for building UIs. It encourages you to separate functionality into &amp;lsquo;components&amp;rsquo; which are used used like traditional HTML tags. Since code is treated as separate units, this makes code easier to organize and very easy for humans to read. For example the collapsible menu for the site was only:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;SlideMenu&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;MenuItems&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/MenuItems&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;MenuPanel &amp;gt;{this.props.children}&amp;lt;/MenuPanel&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/SlideMenu&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it rendered as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/menu-demo.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Menu Image&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately most browsers don&amp;rsquo;t support the newest JavaScript functionality out of the box, and there are same &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features&#34;&gt;great improvements&lt;/a&gt; coming in future versions ofJavaScript. With this in mind, I decided to use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://babeljs.io/&#34;&gt;Babel&lt;/a&gt; transpiler to write the new ES6 JavaScript for The Playbook and convert it the current JavaScript that most browsers expect. The let me use modern JavaScript features such as promises, lambdas, and classes. Since the entire front end was essentially a single page JavaScript webapp, I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://webpack.github.io/&#34;&gt;webpack&lt;/a&gt; to bundle all the assets into static files that could be served from the Parse servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://playbook.parseapp.com&#34;&gt;The Playbook&lt;/a&gt; is still in use, however it is in closed beta for teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Marie Antoinette&#39;s Gluten-Free Bake Shoppe</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects/maries/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/projects/maries/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Marie Antoinette&amp;rsquo;s site had the following requirements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display information about the bakery(contact, hours, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow customers to browse and search the in store menu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow customers to place online orders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a separate menu and order placement system for vendors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Admin ability to edit menu items and approve new vendors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quick development is preferable as the current site lacks functionality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I considered using an off the shelf solution such as Shopify or Magneto. Creating a content management system and ordering system from the ground up is quite a bit of work. Unfortunately, none of the existing systems I could find were able to satisfy all of the requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The front end was built using AngularJS and Bootstrap 3. AngularJS strength lies in its two way data binding as well as the large selection of third party libraries. Functionality such as filtering a list of menu items based on a query or by type is fairly trivial to do with AngularJS. Coupling AngularJS with Bootstrap allowed me to rapidly set up, try out, and iterate the front end. Bootstrap is also created to be customizable out of the box, so changing how everything looked was no problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the back end I chose to use the &lt;a href=&#34;http://golang.org/&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; programming language. I had been using Go in my side projects for a while and I had come to appreciate its strengths:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A robust standard library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to deploy to a variety of platforms, I chose &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.heroku.com/&#34;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built in concurrency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Official library support for &lt;a href=&#34;https://stripe.com/&#34;&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt;(our payment processor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose to use the &lt;a href=&#34;http://martini.codegangsta.io/&#34;&gt;Martini&lt;/a&gt; web framework after hearing about in on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://changelog.com/117/&#34;&gt;Changelog Podcast&lt;/a&gt;. Martini has several upgrades the from the built in Go web framework including improved routing and middleware support. I also chose to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jinzhu/gorm&#34;&gt;GORM&lt;/a&gt; to connect to the database. Using an ORM library over manual SQL queries made sense here since development speed was more important than raw performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site is still up and running today! You can check it out &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mariesglutenfree.com&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
